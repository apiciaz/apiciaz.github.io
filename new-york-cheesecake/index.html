            <blockquote>
<p>The secret ingredient to a dense, rich cheesecake is goat cheese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheesecake is a staple at our home. It holds a permanent place in everyone's Top 3 cakes. Given its simplicity and readily available ingredients, we make it frequently, almost too often.</p>
<p>After testing many recipes and experimenting with all sorts of milk derivatives (sour cream, yogurt, cream, ricotta, etc.), I have settled on the one- It strikes the perfect balance between easy-to-make and complex flavors.</p>
<p>Most of all, this recipe yields a taste closest to what I remember, of the bite that made me fall in love with cheesecake. I was in Boston, not New York, sitting next to the large window in Joe's American Bar &amp; Grill on Newbury Street. It was a warm late November afternoon. We greedily absorbed the last rays of sunshine of the day. On the table, there was a generous slice of cheesecake and a small cup of espresso.</p>
<p>And memories fade. Did we share the cheesecake, health-conscious as we were?All there is to recall, ten years after, is the satisfaction from twirling every bite of the cheesecake between my tongue tip and the roof of my mouth—the unpacking of flavors, from sweet to creamy, and to a lingering tangy taste. My standards for a good cheesecake:</p>
<ol>
<li>moderately sweet</li>
<li>layers of flavors</li>
<li>tall</li>
<li>a crust that texturally contrasts with the body</li>
<li>satisfying yet not overwhelming.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="flavored-oatmeal-crust">Flavored Oatmeal Crust</h3>
<p>I have some instant Quaker oat pouches of maple syrup, banana cream, strawberry cream flavors in my pantry. They smell amazing and don't have a place on our breakfast menu. So in place of orange water in the original recipe, I use this instant oatmeal to set a predominant scent and make the crust. Basically, I throw two pouches into the food processor and pulse for a few seconds. Once the oats become flour-ish(ok to have some large flakes), pour it in the mold and spread evenly. Add some melted butter, mix with the oats, and use a spatula to make an evenly pressed layer at the bottom.</p>
<p>The best part? No need to pre-bake. Just leave the mold in the oven during pre-heating for a few minutes.</p>
<p>A crust is crumbs of graham crackers/oats/animal crackers/biscuits/your imagination plus melted butter. So long as it stays together and is not too hard to cut through after being baked (which happens when there's not enough butter), it's a crust.</p>
<h3 id="the-cheesecake">The Cheesecake</h3>
<p>Side note: I timed myself in my last run- it took 25 minutes from taking out the ingredietns from the fridge to sliding the mold into the oven.</p>
<p>Ingredients at room temperature is key to a smooth bouncy batter. After weighing cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, I leave the bowl out to warm up. During this time, take out the eggs, weigh sugar, and place the saucepan with 85ml of cream on stove.</p>

<p>Add sugar (to your taste) and a pinch of Kosher salt. I find 40-50g is the sweet spot. Mix on low.</p>

Preheat the oven to 450 F. Toast the oatmeal crust for a few minutes. Don't burn it!!<br>
Boil 85ml of cream and pour into the mixture while the mixer is on low speed.</p>
<p>Bake at 450 F for 20 min. Turn off the oven and leave the door ajar for 10 min. Then bake at 250 F for 30 min. Every oven is different. Keep an eye on the cake and use visual &amp; olfactory cues.<br>
