<p>A critical rebuttal and expansion of Frankfurt's understanding of bullshit</p>
<ol>
<li>Frankfurt's bullshit takes place in everyday life- how about academic bullshit?</li>
<li>Frankfurt only talks about the bullshit produced by a bullshitter bullshitting- how about when the production process of bullshit is not so central?</li>
<li>Frankfurt contradicts himself when pinpointing the essence of bullshit when he first considers bullshit as something that cannot be specified.</li>
<li>Cohen's assumption: anyone in any kind of state of mind can talk nonsense. Let's talk about bullshit where the output's senselessness is more important.</li>
<li>What's nonsense? <strong>unclarifiable unclarity</strong>:
<ol>
<li>-(text) does not change what one can understand from (text)</li>
<li>does not stir up interpretations</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Who's a bullshitter?
<ol>
<li>aim-bullshitter</li>
<li>disposition-bullshitter</li>
<li>Innocent people who produce things that don't make sense are not bullshitters!</li>
</ol>

<p>I liked Frankfurt's article right away- for its unequivocal criticism of those bullshitters with no regard for the truth and its lamentation for the bygone era where people once believed in stability, eternity, and correctness. Frankfurt made clear the distinction between liars and bullshitters. Though both violated the truth for ulterior purposes, the former acknowledged the existence of truth and assumed differences between the right and the wrong. I want to add a point here. The line was relatively thin as one could swiftly switch from lying to bullshitting as he/she saw no harm in deviating from the truth. Getting away with lies reassured a liar that his audience was not acute and gave him the confidence to break free from the true/false framework. Bullshitters were not bound to that structure. Frankfurt compared them to artists whose creativity ran as needed, while liars, on the other hand, were craftsmen that polished the craft of spreading falsehood. It was the disrespect and disregard for how things were that made bullshitters arrogant and irritating.</p>
<p>Then why did people tend to be more lenient towards a bullshitter than a liar? Was contempt easier to swallow than betrayal? Or it was because we felt some sympathy towards someone so cynical that he no longer believed in knowing anything for sure?</p>
<p>Frankfurt mentioned a few scenarios where people had to talk about things beyond their capability to know- like politics, economy, and history. The overwhelming assumption that we must have something to say about these topics led to the production of bullshit. My struggle with bullshit happened mostly in classrooms. Peers that skimmed readings but talked nonstop to impress had little to no respect for authors. A grading system that valued class participation created a need for opinions. Classrooms, designed initially to be a place where different opinions could collide and further complicate a conversation, became circumstances where people had to talk about things that they did not know much. How could a 15-year-old at a private school talk about the origins of inequality when no one has taught him the humility to open up a book and try to understand what others have to say? When the first thing a student encounters is a grading system that places importance on opinions, not humbleness, nor comprehension or respect for the truth, bullshit runs rampant and spills beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>It is not enough to spot bullshit. A more profound impact of this class is to consciously stop the production of bullshit.</p>
